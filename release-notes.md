# antlr-ng Release Notes

## 0.6.0

Fixed two problems in the token vocab parser (key/value parsing and import location).

The tool is now bootstrapping itself, that is, the parsers needed for the tool and its tests are now generated by the previous version of itself. No Java needed anymore!

## 0.5.2

Improved action escape handling. A simple search and replace doesn't work well.

## 0.5.1

Token vocab import handling was fixed and the lib dir parameter finally included in the import path search.

## 0.5.0

First public release, for public testing. Still some way to go.

## 0.4.0

The tool went through intensive testing by Ken Domino, who sent it through the entire grammar-v4 repository. Fixed quite a few bugs that came out of that.

## 0.3.0

All tool tests have been ported to TypeScript and are now running fine. The tool is now fully functional and can be used to generate parsers and lexers in TypeScript. However, the tests don't cover all features yet (listeners, visitors etc.), so there might still be some issues.

## 0.2.0

- Big reorganization of the project. Everything of the TS runtime has been moved to an own project.
- The tool files all build fine now.
- Had to add ports for certain ANTLR3 classes for now.
- Tool unit tests are not fixed yet.


## 0.1.0

- Initial commit.
- TypeScript files generated from Java.
- At this point the project contained both, the ANTLR4 tool and the ANTLR4 TS runtime.
